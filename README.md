# TicTacToe-Infinity

This project is an implementation of an infinite Tic-Tac-Toe game using ReactJS. 
The game extends the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe mechanics by introducing a larger, adjustable grid and a unique rule where the oldest mark of a player is removed after placing their fourth mark, keeping only three active marks on the board at any time. 
This creates an engaging and challenging game experience.
